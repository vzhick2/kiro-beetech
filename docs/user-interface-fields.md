# User Interface Fields Guide

This document outlines which database fields should be visible to users in the finished KIRO inventory management app, and which should remain hidden as technical implementation details.

**General Principle**: Show users what they need to make decisions and take action, while hiding the technical complexity that powers the system behind the scenes.

**Schema Alignment**: This guide reflects the exact fields available in the current Supabase database as of January 27, 2025.

## üõçÔ∏è Items Management

### Always Visible Fields

- **Item Name** (`name`) - Primary identifier users will recognize ("Organic Rose Hip Oil", "2oz Glass Jars")
- **Current Quantity** (`currentquantity`) - Critical for inventory decisions and day-to-day operations
- **Unit of Measure** (`inventoryunit`) - Essential context ("oz", "pieces", "ml") so users know what the quantity means
- **Tracking Mode** (`tracking_mode`) - Users need to understand if an item is "fully_tracked" or "cost_added" to set expectations
- **Item Type** (`type`) - Basic categorization: "ingredient", "packaging", "product"

### Conditionally Visible Fields

- **SKU** (`sku`) - Show if users want detailed tracking, hide if it clutters the interface
- **Reorder Point** (`reorderpoint`) - Important for inventory management but could be in an "advanced" section
- **Weighted Average Cost** (`weightedaveragecost`) - Show to managers or in cost-focused views only
- **Primary Supplier** (`primarysupplierid`) - Useful for reordering but not always needed
- **Lead Time Days** (`leadtimedays`) - Planning information, conditionally visible
- **Last Counted Date** (`lastcounteddate`) - Useful for cycle count planning

### Hidden from Users

- **Item ID** (`itemid`) - Technical UUID primary key
- **Database timestamps** (`created_at`, `updated_at`) - Replace with user-friendly "Last modified" when relevant
- **Last Inventory Snapshot** (`last_inventory_snapshot`) - Technical field for tracking mode changes
- **Archive Status** (`isarchived`) - Handle through filtering, not direct display

## üè¢ Supplier Management

## ‚öôÔ∏è General UI Principles

### Always Hide

- **Primary keys, foreign keys** - All UUID fields (itemid, supplierid, purchaseid, etc.)
- **Created/updated timestamps** - Replace with user-friendly "Last modified" dates when relevant
- **Technical flags** - Internal system configuration fields
- **Archive flags** - Handle through filtering rather than explicit display

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

- **Basic view** - Name, quantity/status, key actions
- **Detailed view** - Full information when user clicks for more details
- **Advanced/Manager view** - Financial data, cost breakdowns, system analytics

### Mobile Considerations

- **Prioritize essential fields** on small screens
- **Use expandable sections** for secondary information
- **Show critical alerts prominently** but collapse details
- **Make key actions easily accessible** with proper touch targets

## üéØ Context-Specific Visibility

### Production View

- Show recipe ingredients, quantities, batch status
- Hide financial details unless specifically requested
- Emphasize timing and process steps

### Financial View

- Show costs, margins, purchasing data
- Hide production details unless relevant
- Emphasize trends and profitability

### Inventory View

- Show quantities, tracking modes, reorder points
- Hide recipe details unless managing ingredients
- Emphasize stock levels and movement

## üîß Current Database Limitations

### Missing Fields (for future enhancement)

- **Item Categories**: Currently only basic `type` enum, no detailed categorization
- **Item Descriptions**: No description field for detailed item information
- **Supplier Contact Person**: No separate contact person field
- **Purchase Status Enum**: Currently only `isdraft` boolean, not full status workflow

### Working Within Current Schema

- Use `type` field for basic categorization (ingredient/packaging/product)
- Use `notes` fields for additional context where needed
- Handle status workflows through `isdraft` boolean interpretation
- Leverage relationships for display names and additional context

The key principle remains **contextual relevance** - users should see exactly what they need for their current task, with the ability to drill down for more detail when needed, while working within the current database structure.
