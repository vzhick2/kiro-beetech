## 🔄 **Task Management Notes**

### **Key Architectural Decisions**

- **Simplified Workflow**: Focus on 80/20 rule for COGS tracking
- **Statement-Based Entry**: Monthly inventory sessions vs real-time entry
- **Two-Mode Tracking**: Simplified to two modes based on user feedback:
  - `fully_tracked`: Show quantities, alerts, reorder points (core ingredients)
  - `cost_added`: Hide quantities, show costs only (packaging, consumables)
- **Data Preservation**: Quantities stay in database when switching to cost-only mode
- **Cost Transparency**: Separate base costs from allocated overhead
- **Variance Tolerance**: Business-friendly $0.50 variance threshold

### **Next Priority Areas**

1. **Statement-Based Workflow UI**: Design monthly inventory session interface
2. **Recipe Enhancement**: Two-mode ingredient support with true costing
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interfaces for production floor
4. **Bookkeeping Integration**: Export and reconciliation tools

### **Technical Debt Addressed**

- ✅ Fixed broken WAC calculation algorithm
- ✅ Eliminated over-engineered forecasting system
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate business rule implementations
- ✅ Standardized transaction type handling
- ✅ Improved error handling and validation

### **Dependencies Met**

- All core business logic fixes completed ✅
