Spreadsheet Mode on this suppliers page allows users to rapidly edit multiple supplier rows in a grid-like, Excel-style interface. When activated:

All rows become editable at once, with input fields replacing display cells.
Users can navigate between cells using the keyboard (Tab, Enter, arrow keys).
Bulk changes can be made quickly without opening individual row editors.
There are controls to save all changes at once or cancel/revert edits.
Visual cues (such as row highlighting) indicate which rows have unsaved changes.
Designed for high-efficiency data entry and correction, especially useful for batch updates in workshop/field scenarios.
