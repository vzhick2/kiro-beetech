### **Security and Optimization (2025-07-21)**

- Server actions are now restricted to trusted domains via `serverActions.allowedOrigins` in `next.config.ts`.
- No images currently used in the UI; if added in the future, use Next.js `<Image />` for performance and LCP.

### **Spreadsheet-Lite Bulk Editing** (2025-07-21)

- All major data tables (suppliers, items, purchases, batches, etc.) will support inline, spreadsheet-like editing and batch operations.
- Implementation will use TanStack Table v8 for robust grid features.
- Each table will be bespoke, with master-detail views as needed.
- Focus is on minimizing user time and maximizing flexibility for small business workflows.
