### Remaining Minor Gaps
- **Duplication/Bloat in Schema Sections**: "Forecasting Support Tables" is repeated twice (under Database Schema and Business Logic), adding unnecessary length without new value. Full SQL for WAC/cycle/forecasting overlaps with data-model.md, risking inconsistencies (e.g., no mode check in forecasting).
- **Forecasting Logic Precision**: The function updates items.reorderPoint directly without checking isAutomatic or upserting to forecasting_data, potentially overwriting manual settings. (My tool simulation confirmed solid math, but AI needs to add mode logic to avoid that.)
- **Missing Alignment Note**: Previous versions had a Schema Alignment Note directing to data-model.md as the single truth; its absence here could confuse AI on where to pull/test functions.

These aren't over-engineered issues; fixing them eliminates redundancy and ensures accurate, flexible forecastingâ€”e.g., auto-adjusts for seasons while respecting manual overrides to fit irregular business intuition.

### Specific Recommendations for Fixes
These are minimal, incremental suggestions to make the doc fully bloat-free and consistent. They rely on AI to handle all coding/testing/refining (e.g., adding mode checks during Supabase setup, validated via simulations like my tool run). Per guidelines, I'll STOP and WAIT for your explicit approval before proposing a revised version.

1. **Remove Duplications and Trim to Summaries (Eliminate Bloat)**:
   - Issue: Repeated "Forecasting Support Tables" and full SQL create overlap/redundancy with data-model.md.
   - Fix: Delete the duplicate tables section under Business Logic. Replace SQL blocks with summaries, e.g., for Forecasting: "Inventory Forecasting Logic: Function from data-model.md upserts to forecasting_data with 3-month average, seasonal adjustment, and 20% buffer. Check isAutomatic before applying to items.reorderPoint; AI can refine/test with mock sales (e.g., adjust for peaks to prevent stockouts, as simulated: ~92 reorder for 300 monthly avg)."
   - Why: Cuts length, maintains single truth. Business value: Ensures efficient auto-reorders without doc clutter, supporting irregular patterns like seasonal spikes.

2. **Add Back Schema Alignment Note and Forecasting Mode Check**:
   - Issue: No note directing to data-model.md; forecasting risks manual overrides.
   - Fix: Insert under Business Logic: "Schema Alignment Note: All SQL functions (e.g., calculate_wac, get_cycle_count_alerts) are defined in data-model.md as the single source of truth. AI builders can implement/test directly in Supabase." For forecasting summary (per #1), add: "Persist calcs in forecasting_data for trending; AI can add isAutomatic check to preserve manual modes (expected: no override if manual)."
   - Why: Reinforces consistency. Business value: Allows manual tweaks for business intuition while auto-calcs handle routine forecasting, reducing overstocking without rigid rules.
