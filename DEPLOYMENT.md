# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] ESLint passes without errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] All tests passing (when implemented)
- [ ] Build succeeds locally (`npm run build`)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Database connections tested
- [ ] API endpoints validated
- [ ] Third-party integrations verified

### Performance & Security
- [ ] Images optimized (Next.js Image component used)
- [ ] Bundle size analyzed (`npm run build:analyze`)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] CSP (Content Security Policy) reviewed

### Deployment
- [ ] Git repository clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Production branch merged
- [ ] Version tagged (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployment script tested

## Deployment Commands

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Preview deployment
npm run deploy

# Production deployment
npm run deploy:prod

# Manual preview (no validation)
npm run deploy:preview

# Manual production (no validation)
npm run deploy:vercel
```

### Advanced Commands
```bash
# Deploy with tests skipped
node scripts/deploy.js --skip-tests

# Production with tests skipped
node scripts/deploy.js --prod --skip-tests
```

## Post-deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works across all pages
- [ ] Forms submit successfully
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database operations function properly

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] Core Web Vitals metrics good
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] SEO meta tags present

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Uptime monitoring enabled
- [ ] Analytics tracking verified

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for error details
2. Review deployment logs
3. Test locally with `npm run preview`
4. If needed, revert to previous deployment in Vercel
5. Fix issues and redeploy

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure environment variables are available

### Runtime Errors
- Check Vercel function logs
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Confirm database connections

### Performance Issues
- Run bundle analysis: `npm run build:analyze`
- Optimize images and assets
- Review code splitting strategy
