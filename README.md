## 📋 **Overview**

KIRO is a **private, business-focused inventory management system** designed specifically for small businesses that prioritize meaningful COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) tracking over perfectionist inventory management. Following the 80/20 rule, it focuses on tracking what matters most for profitability while supporting real-world business workflows like statement-based bookkeeping and monthly inventory sessions.
