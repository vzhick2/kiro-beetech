2. **Purchase Management** (Task 4.1-4.3)
   - Build Purchase Inbox component
   - Implement CSV import workflow
   - Create line item management interface

3. **Recipe and Batch System** (Task 5.1-5.2)

   - Template system for common batches

## Design Compliance

### âœ… Design Requirements Met
- **Color Scheme**: Exact match to BigCommerce design
- **Typography**: System fonts with proper weights
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons matching the aesthetic
- **Spacing**: Consistent 6/4 unit system
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with unified components
- **Interactions**: Smooth hover states and animations

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Design Decisions
1. **Unified Sidebar**: Same component for mobile/desktop (no Sheet component)
2. **Fixed Header**: Consistent positioning with proper z-index
3. **No Transparency**: Clean solid backgrounds as requested

5. **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for mobile interactions

## Architecture Following .kiro Specs

### Database Schema
- Following design.md exactly with all tables and relationships

### Component Structure
- AppLayout as root with unified sidebar
- Feature-specific pages (Items, Purchases, Recipes, etc.)
- Reusable UI components following shadcn/ui patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Development Workflow
1. **Spec-Driven**: Following requirements.md and design.md
2. **Task-Oriented**: Using tasks.md for progress tracking
3. **Iterative**: Building core features before advanced ones
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for business logic as specified

## Development Server
- Running on port 3001 for mobile access
- Accessible at: http://192.168.0.55:3001 (network)
- Hot reloading enabled for rapid development

## Next Session Goals
1. Set up Supabase database schema
2. Implement purchase management workflow
3. Create recipe and batch management
4. Add real-time functionality
5. Implement business logic functions
